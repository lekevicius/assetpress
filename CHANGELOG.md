## 2.0

* **AssetPress Workflow.** AssetPress can now read .assetpress.json files and perform actions based on configuration. See project page for documentation about config files and workflow capabilities.
* **AssetPress Splitter**. A small sub-tool that can split screens (named like "1.0 Home Screen") and images into different folders. Very useful when working with Sketch.
* **Sketch as input**. Instead of passing a directory of exported images, now you can just pass .sketch file itself, and AssetPress will run proper `sketchtool` commands and resize everything.
